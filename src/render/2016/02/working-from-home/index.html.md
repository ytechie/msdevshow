### Working from Home

[Telecommuting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting): As of 2012, estimates suggest that over fifty million U.S. workers (about 40% of the working population) could work from home at least part of the time,[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting#cite_note-11) but in 2008 only 2.5 million employees, excluding the self-employed, considered their home to be their primary place of business.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting#cite_note-12) The number of employees reported to have worked from their home "on their primary job" in 2010 has been reported as 9.4 million (6.6% of the workforce), though, this number might include the self-employed.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting#cite_note-wessel2012-13)

If the 40% of the U.S. population that holds telework-compatible jobs
and wants to work from home did so half of the time:

 - The nation would save 280,000,000 barrels (45,000,000 m3) of oil (37% of Gulf oil imports).
 - The environment would be saved the equivalent of taking 9 million cars permanently off the road.
 - The energy potential from the fuel savings would total more than twice what the U.S. currently produces from all renewable energy sources combined.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting#cite_note-64)

 - Some of Yahoo's most important "communication and collaboration" come from impromptu meetings, discussions between employees and meeting new people around the office, the memo said. It also noted that "speed and quality" were sometimes sacrificed when working from home.
