### LifeHack Tip of the Week

 - [Give Back Box](https://givebackbox.com/amazon) -- [Jeff Blankenburg](https://blankenblog.com/)

If your house is anything like mine, you have an abundance of spare Amazon boxes laying around, waiting to be recycled. In addition, we still have plenty of toys and clothing our children have outgrown, and plenty of other household goods that aren't being put to much use, but are still in great condition.

Did you know you can put that stuff in an Amazon box, and Amazon will pay for the shipping to send it to Goodwill? You can clean out your house, re-use those cardboard boxes, and help a charity all at the same time!

You can print your free shipping labels at [Give Back Box](https://givebackbox.com/amazon)

There's a great video on how it works on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ucN4EjjYDyM)
