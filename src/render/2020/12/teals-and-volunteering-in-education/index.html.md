### TEALS

 - Teaching Education And Literacy in Schools
 - High School Computer science curriculum
 - Pairing Industry Volunteers with educators to get them up to speed with the material in a hands-on approach
   - Teacher has the teaching certificate but not the background on the material
   - The volunteer brings context and real world applications of principles
   - Students enjoy someone other than their teachers in front of them
   - The TEALS program can assist finding volunteers for a school that cannot identify the right kind of professionals themselves.
 - Curriculum
   - Stanford developed -- Microsoft sponsored (paid)
     - Intro to comp sci - snap
     - Intro to comp sci 2 - python
     - AP Comp Sci
     - AP Computer Science Principles
   - Snap -- Based on MIT scratch
     - Block based -- teaches CS concepts
       - Loops
       - Conditionals
       - Variables
       - etc.
   - Python
   - Java
   - More options available
      - JavaScript HTML CSS
 - Types of volunteering
   - Co-teach
     - Teachers have the teaching certificate, but the volunteer leads most of the lessons
   - Teacher Assistants - Lab support
     - Support the class less frequently 2-3 times a week
     - Work hands on with students individually more
     - Support the lesson by interjecting
     - Being a backup 
   - Remote instruction
 - Goals
   - More awareness and introduction of CS into age where there typically is little to none means more people are exposed to it as a career option
   - Diversity. Most students (and adults) have incorrect preconceived notions of the field. This is a way to expose CS to groups of people to show how CS can be fun
     - TEALS looks to schools for a commitment to action in three categories:
       - Diversity in Enrollment
       - Inclusive Learning Space
       - Inclusive Instruction
   - Under staffed / budget schools can participate as equals since this program does not cost them anything and they can have excellent quality volunteers come in
   - This is ultimately a vehicle to enable training of teachers to succeed with the curriculum without volunteer help
 - Real Numbers
   - 10,000 students a year across 455 schools in the US and Canada
   - 1,500 Tech volunteers from 650 companies
     - 85% of volunteers come from outside of Microsoft
   - 35% female students
   - 1 in 5 schools are rural
   - 94% of students believe the volunteers were effective in helping vs teachers alone
   - Students in this program score 8% higher on AP Comp Sci standard test than other programs
