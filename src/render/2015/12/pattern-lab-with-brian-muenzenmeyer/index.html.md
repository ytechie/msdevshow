### Brian Muenzenmeyer

Brian spends his working days in UX/UI design at [Roydan Enterprises](http://roydan.com/) - and waking nights moonlighting as [Crunchy Owl](http://crunchyowl.com/), a small single-man studio.  He contributes to open source projects, maintaining the node port of Brad Frost and Dave Olsen’s Pattern Lab, and is interested in the intersection of performance and responsive design to craft better things that reach more people. When not online, he is enjoying coffee of all qualities, digging up the yard, wearing an afghan, talking about something he heard on public radio, dressing in grayscale, or pretending to play the piano.
