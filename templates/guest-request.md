Some background on the show: We are an independent podcast that is targeted towards developers that use Microsoft technologies. We cover topics such as Windows, Azure, Visual Studio, and more.

We've been fortunate to have such guests as Scott Hanselman, Mads Kristensen, and Jes Borland. You can get a feel of our show by checking out our episode archive at http://msdevshow.com/archives/.

If you agree to be on the show, the next step is for us to schedule a slot for you. That invite will have some additional information. My goal is to make this as easy as possible. I know you have a busy schedule.

Hope to hear from you soon!
