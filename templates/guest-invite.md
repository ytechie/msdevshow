Thank you for agreeing to be on the MS Dev Show podcast. Carl and I started the podcast to get the opportunity to learn from interesting guests such as yourself, and to share those conversations with the developer community.
 
For now, simply accept this invite to confirm. If this slot does not work, let us know and we'll help you reschedule.

Please start thinking about how you would like to be introduced in 1-2 sentences.
 
If you want to get a head start, feel free to take a look at our [guest information page](http://msdevshow.com/guest/). Weâ€™ll include more details later.
 
Approximately 1 day before your scheduled slot, we'll send you an email that has everything you'll need to know to get ready, and will let you know some of the high-level questions we plan on asking. Don't worry, our main goal is to make this as easy as possible for you.
 
Thank you,
Jason and Carl
