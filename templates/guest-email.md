I'm just reaching out to confirm the topic and to give you a heads up on what we have planned.

Scheduled Date/Time:

Hardware/Software:
We use Teams for the podcast. Please use a headset or headphones so that your speakers don't feed back into your microphone.

Recording your own audio track will significantly increase the audio quality of your episode. It takes only seconds to set up. You simply install Audacity, select the correct microphone, and hit record. You can find detailed instructions here: http://msdevshow.com/guest/audio-instructions/ 

Flow of the show:
	1. Guest intro
	2. Listener feedback
	3. News discussion - please jump in and comment
	4. Guest spot - this is you!
	5. Jason/Carl pick of the week
	6. Plugs / end

One of the first things we'll bring up in the pre-show is how you want to be introduced. Short and simple is best. We introduce you at the beginning and encourage you to participate in all segments of the show.

Questions:
We have a set of fallback questions prepped, if things slow down to keep it going. Remember these are fallback questions, we'll try to keep it conversational and they aren't in any particular order. If you have additional questions, or have topics we should avoid, please let us know.
	
 
We'll have a spot towards the end to plug whatever, we already have your twitter handle ready for the show notes. If you have any other links for yourself, website, or other resources you think would be handy, we'll add those too. As a further note, being that you are officially a guest of the show, we add your twitter handle to a twitter list of show guests.
 
Looking forward to chatting,
 
Carl & Jason
